      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”城主大人脸上的笑容忽然凝固了，魔法公会的费雷，自从葛瑞安跟老梅林一战之后，在加洛斯已是仿佛传说一样的人物，即便以艾萨克城主之尊，也没想过这次宴会他会亲自光临。他更没想过，这个传说中的药剂大师，以一人之力，导演了百万金币拍卖会的人物，会是这么一个穿着旧法师袍，看上去不过二十来岁的青年魔法师。</seg>

        <seg>"..." The smile stiffened on the Castellan's face. Felic of the Guild of Magic had been a legendary figure in Jarrosus ever since the battle between Gerian and Old Merlin. Even though Isaac was the castellan, he had never thought Felic would come to this banquet in person. He did not even imagine that the legendary potion master, who alone supplied the million gold coin auction, would be a young mage who looked no more than 20 years old wearing an old mage robe.</seg>

      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">

    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”小梅林只觉眼前一黑，差点没一口血喷了出来，这家伙真的是个疯子，他现在真是连说话的力气都没了，只是勉强抬起手臂，抱着最后一丝侥幸的心理，艰难的报出了一个价格：“八……八十二万……”</seg>

        <seg>"..." Little Merlin could see nothing but blackness, and blood almost spat out from his mouth. This fellow was really a lunatic. He didn't even have the strength to speak; he barely managed to lift his arm and with the idea of leaving things to luck at last, he quoted a price with much difficulty, "8... 820,000..."</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”攀上了传奇境界的魔法师，早已经超越了这个职业本身的范畴，只要是在他精神力覆盖范围之内，他就能掌握他想要掌握的一切东西，林立这鬼鬼祟祟的悄悄话，又怎能瞒过老格林的耳目？</seg>

        <seg>"..." A mage who had reached the legendary realm had already surpassed the scope of this profession itself. As long as it was within the range of his mental powers, he could learn of anything he wanted. How could Lin Li's furtive whispers escape the eyes and ears of Old Grimm?</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">

        <seg>“…” With McGrenn's experience as a lesson, Lin Li hurried to hide behind a tree in case that darned gorilla made another sneak attack with the coconut again.</seg>
      </tuv>

    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”林立也知道，凯文见了葛瑞安，就跟老鼠见了猫似的，怕这胖老头怕得要死，他既然说不知道，那肯定是真的不知道了，于是林立也不再继续纠缠，只是又问了一句：“那推迟到什么时候？”</seg>

        <seg>"..." Lin Li knew that Kevin was as scared of Gerian as the mouse was of the cat whenever he saw the fat old man. Since he had said that he didn't know, then it had to be true. So, Lin Li did not pester further, but asked another question, "Then, until when is it postponed?"</seg>

      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">

    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”林立在那发了足有一分多钟的呆，才有些不太肯定的问了一句：“你是不是气糊涂了？”</seg>

      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”林立太清楚这对父女的性格了，要不是真遇上了无法解决的事，他们绝对不可能找上门来，想到这一点林立有些焦急，匆匆忙忙的就出等级认证大厅，一边往会客室赶去，还一边抱怨着：“怎么不早点通知我……”</seg>

        <seg>"..." Lin Li knew the father and daughter too well. If they had not encountered something that could not be solved, they would never have come for him. Lin Li was somewhat anxious at the thought of this. He rushed out of the level certification hall and hurried over to the reception room as he lamented, "Why didn't you tell me earlier..."</seg>
      </tuv>

      </tuv>

    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”罗琳是真的想学习药剂，她从小就学习医术，又曾受过药剂师指点，等到医术渐渐精深之后，才发现很多医术难以解决的问题，其实只需要一瓶小小的药剂，但安瑞尔世界药剂师如凤毛麟角，即便是以罗琳的尊贵身份，学习药剂也是一件虚无飘渺的事。</seg>

        <seg>"..." Rowling really wanted to learn potion making. She had studied medicine from an early age and had been instructed by a pharmacist. After her medical skills gradually became profound, she discovered that the problems which couldn't be solved with medical skills could actually be solved with a small bottle of a potion. But pharmacists in Anril were rare; even with Rowling's noble status, to learn potion making was a purely imaginary matter.</seg>

    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”老梅林脸色铁青，心里更是把葛瑞安祖宗十八代都给问候遍了，重新打你妈个大西瓜，你现在手里拿着唤醒药剂，只有神经病才想跟你重新打过……</seg>

        <seg>"..." Old Merlin's face turned purple with rage, and in his heart he'd paid greetings to all 18 generations of Gerian's family. A rematch? That son of a watermelon. He had the Awakening potion in his hands now, and only a lunatic would fight him once more...</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”葛瑞安倒吸了一口凉气，曼尼斯家族富甲法兰王国，黑暗年代之后一千三百年，不知藏了多少好东西下来，任人挑选三件这种事，葛瑞安真是连想都没想过……</seg>
      </tuv>
      <tuv lang="EN-US" changeid="Vivian" changedate="20180929T015850Z" creationid="Vivian" creationdate="20180921T144551Z">
        <seg>"..." Gerian gasped in surprise. The Mannes Family was the richest in all of Felan Kingdom. Who knew how much good stuff they had hidden in the 1300 years after the Dark Ages. Gerian had never once imagined such thing as getting to choose any three items...</seg>
      </tuv>
    </tu>
    <tu>
      <tuv lang="ZH-CN">
        <seg>“……”这样的小伎俩，又怎能瞒过灰袍法师，一时间老人不由又好气又好笑，不过以他的身份，自然不能去当面揭穿，只是面色有些尴尬的提醒林立：“这个……费雷，你能先把巴瑟罗尔给放了吗？他要是再这么继续流血，恐怕会有生命危险啊……”</seg>

        <seg>"..." How could such a petty trick escape the eyes of the mage in gray robe? For a moment, the old man felt annoyed yet amused. However, in his capacity, he naturally could not expose him. He merely reminded Lin Li with a look of slight embarrassment on his face, "This... Felic, can you first let Bathrilor off? If he continues to bleed, I'm afraid his life will be in danger..."</seg>

        <seg>"Afraid it's not just bad luck..." Lin Li muttered to himself. After living here for more than a month, he could see that old Andoine's attainments in magic were truly unparalleled. But in pharmaceutics, he was worse than an apprentice who had just started out. An apprentice would at least learn how to do it gradually, but Andoine completely ignored the proper steps and chose to take up challenging tasks from the beginning. Now that there was a potion master around to clean up whatever trouble was caused, the old man became more brazen in his actions, making it seem as if there was Spring Festival celebration everyday in the lab. If there were no explosions someday, it would be because the old man had taken the wrong medicine.</seg>

The fifth stage of the Cast Tripod Realm, in particular, was a bottleneck, the essence force needed was roughly the sum of all the previous stages. As such, many wastrel playboys and inept martial artists like Jiang Ruhu and Ma Fei, were permanently held up at the fourth stage of the Cast Tripod Realm. After all, it would be impossible for their families, however rich they might be, to keep supplying them with elixirs to forcibly elevate to the fifth stage of the Cast Tripod Realm. </seg>

He had, after all, already injured two of his opponent's men; additionally, his opponent recognized the martial arts techniques of the Jiang Clan and had evidently become apprehensive. Why else would that housekeeper not retaliate against him, but rather call for his guards to stand down? Since the opponent temporarily did not dare to fight any longer and asked to negotiate, why not? It would probably be easier to deal with—so long as he could protect Jiang Xiaonu's life as well as that of his own, anything else would be secondary. </seg>
